## About

The build workflow is quite complex when you account for all necessary steps it takes to create a production application. There are multiple different build environments you can build kickstartfx in: Either a development environment or a proper production environment. Due to the complexities, the code for the distribution build workflow is a separate gradle project, the **dist** subproject.

The basic development build, which you most of the time run locally, will get you a basic running application. You are, however, missing stuff like codesigning, AOT training caches, and proper versioning.

The production build will include all steps like signing the code, training AOT data, generating installers, publishing the artifacts, and more. To properly run this build, you will need to have all additional required tools installed for installer generation, signing, and more.

The repository includes a GitHub actions workflow that will run the production build automatically without any user input. This workflow is run on all available operating systems and architectures you choose, and degenerated artifacts are grouped together in a GitHub release.
