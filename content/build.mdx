## About

The build workflow is quite complex when you account for all necessary steps it takes to create a production application. There are multiple different build environments you can build kickstartfx in: Either a development environment or a proper production environment. Due to the complexities, the code for the distribution build workflow is a separate gradle project, the **dist** subproject.

## Gradle setup

The main configuration of the build is done in the root **build.gradle**. There you can change all kinds of variables that are used throughout the build. This includes stuff like the name of your application and the generated artifacts, JVM arguments, JavaFX versions, and more.

## Gradle tasks

The basic development build, which you most of the time run locally, will get you a basic running application. You are, however, missing stuff like codesigning, AOT training caches, and proper versioning. You can run the application in local development mode with `gradlew app:run`.

To generate a runtime image that can be used for production, you can run `gradlew clean dist`. The clean is recommended as some parts of the dist workflow, like external tools, might not work very well in an incremental fashion. To rule out any of these issues, cleaning the project before running the distribution workflow is the safest option.

The `dist` task generates artifacts in `dist/build/dist/artifacts`. These can be used in a production environment. To quickly reinstall your built application on the system, there exists the utility task `distAndInstall`. Running `gradlew clean distAndInstall` will create the production dist and automatically run the generated installer to upgrade the installed application on your system.

When configured and enabled, the production build workflow can include all steps like signing the code, training AOT data, and more. To properly run this build, you will need to have all additional required tools installed for installer generation, signing, and more. For instructions on how to configure the environment to enable signing, see the [Windows](windows-signing) and [macOS](/notarization) pages. Some steps like training the [AOT cache](/aot) are only done on the GitHub runners by default, but can be enabled by changing the variable *enableAot* in the root **build.gradle**.

The repository includes a GitHub actions workflow that will run the production build automatically without any user input. This workflow is run on all available operating systems and architectures you choose, and the generated artifacts are grouped together in a GitHub release.

Note that if you use IntelliJ, preconfigured run configurations of these explained tasks are available in the **.run** directory in the project root.
